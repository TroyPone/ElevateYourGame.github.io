            <p>
                Hi there, I am a former Baltimore Dream basketball player with 23 plus years of basketball coaching experience.  I am a certified basketball coach that has coached at various levels for both boys and girls.  I focus on improving and developing basketball fundamentals. I love helping youth athletes grow their game by focusing on building a strong fundamental foundation.  My areas of expertise are shooting and dribbling but love coaching all aspects of the game.  I am always excited to train players that have the will and heart it requires to play defense.  Being a former basketball Director, I have evaluated and worked with over thousands of youth athletes and have even written training progression curriculums designed to help youth coaches improve.  Currently I am a MIAA varsity assistant coach at Annapolis Area Christian Upper School.  When I am not training players or coaching basketball, I am typically doing a variety of activities with my wife and three children.  Want to work together?  Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
